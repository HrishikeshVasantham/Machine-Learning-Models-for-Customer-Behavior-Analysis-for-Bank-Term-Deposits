# Predictive Analytics for Bank Term Deposits

## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit. Using a dataset from a bank, various machine learning models are applied to understand customer behavior and predict their responses to marketing campaigns. This project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `bank-full.csv`, which contains information on bank customers and their responses to previous marketing campaigns. The dataset includes attributes like age, job, marital status, education, balance, housing loan status, and the outcome of the campaign (whether the customer subscribed to the term deposit).

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and outlier removal.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions and relationships using various plots.
- **Handling Imbalanced Data:** Using Random Over Sampling to balance the target classes.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Implementing and evaluating multiple machine learning models.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
- **Model Evaluation Metrics:** Assessing models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and plotting ROC curves.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn imblearn lightgbm prettytable
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

3. **Run the project:**
   Open the Jupyter notebook or your preferred Python IDE and execute the code provided in `bank_term_deposit_prediction.py` (or the appropriate script/notebook file).

## Data Preprocessing

- **Loading Data:** Importing the dataset and displaying the first few rows.
- **Checking Data Shape:** Inspecting the number of rows and columns.
- **Missing Values and Duplicates:** Checking for and handling missing values and duplicate entries.
- **Data Transformation:** Encoding categorical variables and scaling features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Distribution Plots:** Visualizing distributions of various features.
- **Count Plots:** Analyzing the count of categorical variables.
- **Box Plots:** Observing the distribution and outliers in numerical features.
- **Pie Charts:** Visualizing the proportion of categories in categorical features.
- **Correlation Matrix:** Plotting the correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.

## Model Training and Evaluation

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
- **LightGBM**

Each model is trained, cross-validated, and evaluated using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.

## Results

A comparative analysis of the models is provided, highlighting the performance of each model on the test set. The LightGBM model, after hyperparameter tuning, achieved the highest accuracy and F1-score.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of various machine learning models in predicting bank term deposit subscriptions. The use of hyperparameter tuning and handling imbalanced data significantly improved the model performance.
